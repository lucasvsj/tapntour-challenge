# Show the all tours in a List Component  using TourView.vue file.

As this was my first task, I spent most of my time familiarizing with the project. Exploring the core files and understandig the logic within them.

The main works was focus on setting the correct details of the tour in the `TourItem.vue` file. This also included the modification of `DescriptionItem.vue` and `FeatureItem.vue`.

# Show the all guides in a List Component using GuideView.vue file.

Here I completed the `GuideItem.vue` and `GuideList.vue` files based on the works that I had done on the previous part. It was moslty copy and paste the previous work and modifiying it with the correct content.
As a had to work on `DescriptionItem.vue` too, here conditional rendering was very helpful and useful.


# Show the tour detail in a List Component using  TourDetail.vue file.

This is where the most part of my working time went. At first I harcode the id of the Tour so I could work on the showing of the details itself. Here I created a new file called `TourDetailsItem.vue` to display the details of each tour and mantain a clean project. 

When the time of trying to make it work with the corresponding `id` came, the real challenge happened. I knew the logic (since I've worked on reactive frontends before), but doing it on Vue, a framework I was not so familirize with (and specifictly on Vue3.0), wasn't as easy as I expected. Finally I manage to do it, but not in the way I would have liked.

# Conclusion and Toughts

In conclusion, I liked this challenge. It was a good introduction to Vue and a good way to familirize to a similar project. 
I would really like a little more specification in the details of each task, but I get that it's just a challenge.
